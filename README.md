# Experiments
This repository contains a bunch of stand alone experiments I'm using to evaluate different technologies.

## Running these experiments

Most of these experiments require just a simple http server. I use the standard [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) available via npm:

```
npm install -g http-server
```

Then when inside one of the folders just run to start the server and disable all caching

```
> http-server -c-1

Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
  http://10.210.116.141:8080
  http://192.168.56.1:8080
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```

You can also use [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) to get similar functionality but with automatic reloading when any of your served pages changes.
